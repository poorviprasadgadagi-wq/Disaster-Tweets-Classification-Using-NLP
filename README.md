# Disaster-Tweets-Classification-Using-NLP

Project Overview
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project aimed at classifying tweets related to disasters (like earthquakes, floods, wildfires) to identify whether a tweet is informative (related to a disaster) or not. The system leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning/NLP models to automate disaster-related information detection, which can help in emergency response and decision-making.

Key Features

-Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Collected tweets.

Cleaned text (removed URLs, emojis, punctuation, and stopwords).

Tokenization and normalization for NLP model input.

-Feature Engineering:

Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectors for text representation.

Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for semantic understanding.

-Modeling:

Trained classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and/or LSTM/Transformer models.

Used cross-validation for model evaluation.

-Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for classification performance.

-Visualization & Insights:

Word clouds for frequent disaster-related terms.

Confusion matrix to identify model errors.
